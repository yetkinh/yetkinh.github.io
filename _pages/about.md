I am an assistant professor in Mechatronics Engineering Department at BartÄ±n University, Turkey since March 2019. I completed my PhD at Virginia Tech in 2018 and my Master's degree at The Ohio State University in 2013. During my PhD studies, I worked on probabilistic search theory and worked with [Dr. Daniel Stilwell] (https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/stilwell.html) from Autonomous Systems and Control Lab at VT.
