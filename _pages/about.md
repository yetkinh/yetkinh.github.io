## Bio
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechatronics Engineering at Bartın University, Turkey. I received my PhD degree in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2018, where I was a member of [Autonomous Systems and Control Lab](https://www.ascl.ece.vt.edu/index.html) and advised by [Dr. Daniel Stilwell](https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/stilwell.html). During my PhD studies, I mainly worked on probabilistic search theory with a focus on real-time path planning algorithms for AUVs in subsea search applications. You can read my dissertation entitled "Toward Real-Time Planning for Robotic Search" here.

## Research Interests
My research interests include modeling and solving autonomous decison-making problems for real-world robotic systems. I am particularly interested in multi-agent collaborative search problems where the search domain vary from subsea environments to wilderness. Currently, I am working on a project where the aim is to find the lost person in wilderness as soon as possible with limited resources (human teams, UAV teams, trained dogs, etc...)
