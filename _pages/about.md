I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechatronics Engineering at Bartın University, Turkey. I received my PhD degree in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2018, where I was a member of [Autonomous Systems and Control Lab](https://www.ascl.ece.vt.edu/index.html) and advised by [Dr. Daniel Stilwell](https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/stilwell.html). During my PhD studies, I mainly worked on probabilistic search theory with a focus on real-time path planning algorithms for AUVs in subsea search applications.     



## Education
+ Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering,     Virginia Tech                 2018  
+ M.S.  in Electrical and Computer Engineering,     The Ohio State University     2013
+ B.S.  in Electrical and Electronics Engineering,  Selcuk University, Turkey     2008


## Research Interests

My research interests include modeling and solving autonomous decison-making problems for real-world robotic systems. I am particularly interested in multi-agent collaborative search problems where the search domain vary from subsea environments to wilderness. Currently, I am working on two projects; the first project is from search and rescue domain where the aim is to find the lost person in wilderness as soon as possible with limited resources (human teams, UAV teams, trained dogs, etc...), and the second project is from the underwater robotics domain where the aim is to develop a fully autonomous system that monitors the health of a ship hull.
