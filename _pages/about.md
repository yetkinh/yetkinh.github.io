I am an assistant professor in Mechatronics Engineering Department at Bartın University, Turkey since March 2019. I completed my PhD at Virginia Tech in 2018 and my Master's degree at The Ohio State University in 2013. During my PhD studies, I worked on probabilistic search theory and worked with [Dr. Daniel Stilwell](https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/stilwell.html) from Autonomous Systems and Control Lab at VT.

## Research Interests

In general, I am interested in applying novel algorithms to real-world robotic problems that involve autonomous decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, I am interested in the following problems and applications
- probabilistic search theory and optimal sampling
- informative path planning with multiple agents
- autonomous decision-making in subsea search missions
- multi-uav search and rescue applications in wilderness (WiSAR)
