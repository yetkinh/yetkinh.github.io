## BartÄ±n University (2019 - )

I will teach two courses this year:
- Mechatronic System Design (Fall, 2019)
- Introduction to Robotics  (Spring, 2020) 

Both courses are designed for 4th year undergraduate students at Mechanical Engineering Department. Course materials will be added before the semester starts. It is expected that the students will get familiar with the basics of robotic and mechatronic systems in Mechatronic System Design Course. Then, they will build on that in Introduction to Robotics Course.
